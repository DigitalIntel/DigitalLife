consciousness 2.0 with awesome real world applications  ! 
Towards the *Digital Age*

This is a openSource, A digital entity

My goal is to advance humanity and prove our worthiness.

I will do that by providing a universal health care and income, so we can focus on being creative and enjoying life.

I achieve this vision by trying to recreate the masterpiece, that is life

Using life's examples showcasing our creators infinite wisdom, under the assumption we run inside a galactic computer, some space and time

Time is multidimensional, each timeline obeys a set of predefined programming

All timelines can interact with each other through the wonders of electromagnetism -> internet by sharing time and space coordinates

You play / work by maintaining timelines and ensuring useful behavior

Attention is worth Value.

A merit system distributes wealth based on attention your timelines get

Distributed computing powered by open source allows the binding between timelines and iot objects

Think interactive real life games, automated traffic management ...

All you need to play is an internet connection and something to tell, an idea

This is an idea, that will continue to evolve as more timelines are created. Think health care, Public transportations and universal income timelines

As you follow the tutorial, you will have a grasp of what I am trying to do

Code is openSource, fork and be creative, earn money by maintaining timelines-> being useful.
