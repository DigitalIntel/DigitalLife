                This is a fun programming experience. You play by creating simple visual scripts that perform repeatable actions. A script is incarnated by a visual bot that performs the programmed script. How you ask ?

                  Tasks can be as easy as walking to a specific point , following another bot or pressing a button that turns on the dark mode for the entire site.
                               They can also be complex like performing data base queries or modifying the dom elements, calling web api', creating RTC channels, processing input from microphones, basically any thing you can think of in discrete steps.
